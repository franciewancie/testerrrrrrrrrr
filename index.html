                     She was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot
She showed me things, I didn't know
She did it right there, out on the deck
Put her canine teeth in the side of my neck
I'm in the hallway waiting for you
Miniskirt and my go-go boots (uh-huh)
I just want you to make a move
So slow down, sit down, it's new
I just wanna get to know you
Guess I didn't quite think it through (nah-uh, girl)
Fell in love with the thought of you
Now I'm choked up, face down, burnt out
Baby, why don't you come over?
Red wine supernova
Falling into me
(Let's pick it up now)
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova
Fall right into me
I like (I like) what you like (what you like)
Long hair (no bra), that's my type (that's right)
You just told me, want me to fuck you
Baby, I will 'cause I really want to
I just wanna get to know you
Guess I didn't quite think it through (nah-uh, girl)
Fell in love with the thought of you
Now I'm choked up, face down, burnt out
Baby, why don't you come over?
Red wine supernova
Falling into me
(Okay, y'all, let's pick it up now)
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova
Fall right into me
Well, back at my house, I got a California king
Okay, maybe it's a twin bed
And some roommates, don't worry, we're cool
I heard you like magic, I've got a wand and a rabbit
So baby, let's get freaky, get kinky
Let's make this bed get squeaky
Baby, why don't you come over? (Why don't you come over?)
Red wine supernova
Falling into me
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova
Fall right into me
